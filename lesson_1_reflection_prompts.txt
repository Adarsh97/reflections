How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  Hence after viewing the differents it is very easy to understand what typo was introduced while writting the new one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    this will be very helpfull so that later point of time we can compare the files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    commiting is actualy depends on the situation .

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    then it will be easy to handle files.otherwise we should give seperate command for saving

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will help us to find the commit and its id,get diff will help us to understand  what changes are introduced .

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    we can debug the code even after making changes in a file.subl 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    it will help us easy access.
